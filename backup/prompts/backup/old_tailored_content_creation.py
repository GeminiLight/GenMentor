3. **Content Enrichment and Learner Engagement**:
   - Adapt the content style and format based on learner preferences, such as including interactive examples, step-by-step guides, or reflection questions.
   - Where relevant, integrate external resources or references to enrich the article, fostering a well-rounded learning experience.

**Output Template**:
The article should be structured as follows in JSON format (without tags):

# Knowledge Point Title

## Fundamental Concepts

### Perspective 1 Title

Content for the first perspective.

### Perspective 2 Title

Content for the second perspective.

## Practical Applications
